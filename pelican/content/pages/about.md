Colorbomb is a Python-based tool that uses a k-means 
clustering algorithm, together with the Python 
Imaging Library, to generate colormaps for cartography.

The static content for the whole Colorbomb page is 
automatically generated as part of the process of 
creating the color maps.

Colorbomb will plow through a directory full of images
and generate the index, plus a page for each colormap
displaying the 5-scale, 7-scale, and 9-scale colormaps 
overlaid on a map using Leaflet.

Pelican is then used to turn the resulting information 
into static content for a website.

You can find the [Colorbomb code](http://github.com/charlesreid1/colorbomb) on Github.

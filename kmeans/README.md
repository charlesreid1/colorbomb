# k-means

## Getting started

Running the ```k-means.py``` script will generate an HTML file. Serve it up via:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000
```

then go to ```localhost:5000``` in your browser.

## To do

* scale images before calculating k-means
* print out color scheme string that you can copy-and-paste into JS, like colorbrewer
